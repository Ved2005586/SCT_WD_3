# Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ¯

A simple browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Play against a friend on the same device â€” first to get three in a row wins!

## How It Works
- Players take turns marking `X` and `O` on the 3Ã—3 grid.
- The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all squares are filled with no winner, itâ€™s a draw.
- Click **Restart Game** to start over anytime.
